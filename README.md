## MCM PROBLEM B: Merge After Toll

Team: Herrick Fang, (Mek) Teerapat Jenrungrot, Ziyang Zhang

[Problem](problem.pdf)

[Solution](solution.pdf)

We worked on finding a way to optimize toll booths. We made a quick model in the .cc file that simulates cars.
It attempts to model our assumptions and collision ratios that you can adjust.

`g++ -o model cellular_automata.cc && ./model `

Then, we *attempted* to make a paper based on what we found. 

Overall, a fun 3 day project~
